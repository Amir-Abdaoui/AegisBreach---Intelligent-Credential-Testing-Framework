Explicit Authorization Required: Cannot run without valid auth token

Scope Limitation: Only tests targets in authorized list

Rate Limiting: Built-in to prevent denial-of-service

No Privileged Accounts: Won't test admin/root accounts by default

Full Audit Trail: All attempts logged with timestamps

Safe-Test Mode: Can test against local mock server first

Automatic Pause: Pauses if suspicious activity detected

This framework represents a next-generation approach to credential testing that prioritizes intelligence, adaptation, and ethical compliance over brute force. It's designed for professional security assessments where precision and stealth are more valuable than raw speed.
